# Suggestions for Ad System Improvements

## Chat Experience
1.  **Contextual Start**: When a chat starts from an Ad, automatically insert a system message or a "quoted" message showing the Ad Title and Price, so the context is clear.
2.  **Quick Replies**: Add "canned responses" for buyers, e.g., "Is this item still available?", "When can I pick it up?", "Is the price negotiable?".
3.  **Safety Tips**: Display a safety warning at the top of the chat (e.g., "Meet in public places", "Do not send money in advance").
4.  **Availability Status**: Show if the seller is currently "Online" or "Last seen X minutes ago".

## Ad Interaction
1.  **Offer Button**: Allow buyers to make a formal "Offer" within the chat, which the seller can "Accept" or "Decline".
2.  **Seller Options**: Allow sellers to "Mark as Sold" directly from the chat menu.
3.  **Reviews**: After a transaction (or if the ad is marked sold to a specific user), prompt the buyer to leave a review for the seller.

## Notifications
1.  **Push Notifications**: Ensure immediate push notifications for new chat messages, especially for the first message from a potential buyer.
2.  **Email Fallback**: If the seller is offline, send an email digest of unread messages.

## General
1.  **Hide Phone Number**: Keep the phone number hidden by default or completely remove it from the database if the Chat is the primary and only contact method, to prevent spam.
2.  **Map Integration**: Show the approximate location (district level) on a map in the Ad Detail view.
