# Product Guidelines

## Communication Style
- **Tone & Voice**: The system adopts a **Professional & Informative** tone. Responses should be clear, concise, and focused on providing accurate information. The language should be formal yet accessible, ensuring that users feel they are receiving high-quality, reliable data.

## Visual Identity
- **Design Philosophy**: Both the mobile app and the admin dashboard follow a **Modern & Minimalist** aesthetic. This involves prioritizing clean lines, ample whitespace, and high-contrast typography to ensure content remains the focal point and navigation is effortless.

## User Trust & Data Integrity
- **Transparency & Grounding**: To maintain user trust, the system must clearly indicate when a response is AI-generated. Furthermore, every response should be grounded in the indexed documents, providing explicit citations or references to the source material used for generation.

## AI Behavior & Safety
- **Handling Uncertainty**: When the system cannot find a definitive answer within the provided document context, it must practice **Honest Uncertainty**. It should clearly state that the information is not available in its knowledge base rather than hallucinating or providing potentially misleading information.
