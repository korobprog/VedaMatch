# Initial Concept
A modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Python 3.12+, featuring document indexing, semantic search, and LLM-powered response generation.

# Product Guide

## Target Users
- **End-users**: Individuals seeking intelligent, document-based chat assistance through a dedicated mobile application.
- **Administrators**: Professionals responsible for managing document libraries, user access, and monitoring system configurations and performance.

## Goals
- **High-Accuracy Retrieval**: Deliver fast and highly accurate semantic search results across extensive document repositories to ensure the foundation of RAG is solid.
- **Seamless Mobile Interaction**: Provide an intuitive and performant mobile experience that allows users to interact naturally with AI-driven knowledge on the go.
- **Efficient System Management**: Empower administrators with a comprehensive dashboard for effortless management of document ingestion, user oversight, and performance tracking.

## Core Features
- **Advanced Semantic Indexing**: Utilizing state-of-the-art embeddings to index and retrieve document chunks based on meaning rather than just keywords.
- **AI-Powered Mobile Chat**: A cross-platform mobile interface enabling users to query the knowledge base and receive context-aware, generated responses.
- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**: A centralized web interface for document management, system monitoring, and administrative controls.

## Success Criteria
- **Response Quality**: The primary measure of success is the accuracy, relevance, and contextual grounding of the RAG-generated responses.
